        <span class="highlight hover-41">what is school? why do we go to school? why do students hate school? how can school be changed to improve the learning of the students?</span> 

        well school is a place for students to learn and socialise. we are suppose to learn things that we will need later on in life. this is true. we expand our minds at school and become smarter and more intelligent. we talk to others and our language structure improves and becomes stronger. our vocabulary becomes better, when we learn different words.

        students probably hate school for many reasons. they hate just the word school and quiver up and go into a corner to hide. some hate the teachers or the school staff there. some hate the environment an decide the it ain’t a good environment, maybe because of someone that bug them or because of rumours spread about them or someone close to them. mostly it is the teachers or staff that don’t treat them how they feel they should be treated.

        i agree with this. since I’ve had the problems of teachers many of times. so in high school you can transfer out of the class and get a new teacher that may be better or not.

        the way we learn needs to change. <span class="highlight hover-42">all teachers should make learning fun. make games out of it.</span> you learn better that way and the pressure of doing good is relieved. classes also need to be shortened, because i get so much free time to talk when the teacher is done with a lesson. that time could be taken up by leaning a new subject in school, but no, the people in the districts have to make the scheduled so that people are wasting them.

        i would rather get out of school early. say 11 or 12, like alternative schools do. and they learn everything we learn, but in a stricter way. I’m not saying go to the stricter learning, but don’t waste time and make every class fun to learn. doesn’t that sound like a better idea. once again the student thinks of a good idea for changing school. cock in a guys beer, its funny as hell and its okay to laugh.” — THE END.
