      <div class="project-text">
        <span class="italic">Make It A Party Wherever You Go</span> is a project responding to a current issue about urban public space in Melbourne. This project includes an urban intervention <span class="pt-hover">(a party table)</span> and a printed publication as a response.

        <br><br>
        The party table allows people to gather and socialise in public space— turning any space into great social places. The intervention consists of a bar table on a trolley, complemented with a flower in a vase, an ashtray, two coat hangers and an instruction sheet.

        <span class="italic">“A good city is like a good party— People stay longer than really necessary, because they are enjoying themselves.”</span>— Jan Gehl <br><br>

        Public spaces are an important part of our cities as they provide opportunities for people to gather and engage with the community. However, things are a bit different in the Australian context. Throughout history, under the influence of European colonisation, the Melbourne city was never designed to encourage sociality in public space as such could promote rebellion. As a result, people claiming spaces in alleyways, corners and car parks as their social public space, has becomes a “normal” part of our urban social life. <br><br>

        As a response to this issue, <span class="italic">Make It A Party Wherever You Go</span> aims to increase people’s awareness of their physical surroundings and hopes to encourage and promote interaction with the urban public space.

        "When you’re working hard to sustain your creative vision and your livelihood, it can be hard to prioritize your own physical and mental health. But feeling physically strong and emotionally grounded is essential to maintaining focus, staying inspired, and doing your best work. So what does it take to feel good about your own body, mind, and overall wellbeing—and how can a creative practice feed into one’s health?" 
        (<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/feeling-healthy/" target="_blank">The Creative Independent</a>.)

        <br><br>
        One thing I've learnt about maintaining my emotional health is that you have to view your problems from the right perspective. When you view things from the inside, you can see what the problem is hence able to solve it, but when you are on the outside, things don't appear as straight forward as they may be.

        <span class="italic">Is Collingwood Getting Safer?</span> Is a short video representing my proposition for the use of a disused space in 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/45+Keele+St,+Collingwood+VIC+3066/@-37.7970574,144.9865306,3a,75y,188.48h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sI_v9Wrg3r-zz8D6F-esO3A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad6431ed373851b:0x9269efe1d57b1c48!8m2!3d-37.7972678!4d144.9864909" target="_blank">Collingwood @45 Keele St. </a> (was a disused studio space).

        <br><br>
        Through exploration and research of Collingwood and interviewing its people— residents, people who work there, students, etc. There seems to be debates on whether Collingwood is actually getting better or worse drawing attention to safety concerns.

        <br><br>
        As a response to this issue, I propose to use the studio space as an installation of CCTV— turning the studio into a virtual alternate of an outdoor space in Collingwood, where people in the studio and people on the street can see each other through live footage on the TVs. As a result, people in the studio unconsciously familiarise themselves with the space on the street (through cctv), and people on the street can feel a sense of security seeing people in the studio are watching out for them. The aim is so that people can feel safer being and living in Collingwood.

        <br><br>
        <span class="italic">Is Collingwood Getting Safer?</span> depicts the reflection of CCTV camera watching the place. The mirror indicates it is the same place at the same time.

        <br> <br>
        Sometimes I find myself trapped within a space of thought that I refer to as "fluffy" thoughts–– disturbing and depressing thoughts that find their way to feed on their host. These annoying thoughts in a way "tickle" your heart leading to feelings of suffocation. However, these feelings may go away (for a brief second) when the mind is being distracted by physical activities. 

        <br> <br>
        Trapped Within communicates the idea that some people get trapped within a world of anxiety and depression that only a sense of distraction could part them from that world. Although shortly after the distracting activity has been performed, "fluffy" thoughts return and continue to feed on their host.
