        <span class="italic">Feeling Healthy On The Inside</span> is a guide for students about how to stay emotionally healthy. This is a public Website for the public good.

        "When you’re working hard to sustain your creative vision and your livelihood, it can be hard to prioritize your own physical and mental health. But feeling physically strong and emotionally grounded is essential to maintaining focus, staying inspired, and doing your best work. So what does it take to feel good about your own body, mind, and overall wellbeing—and how can a creative practice feed into one’s health?" 
        (<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/feeling-healthy/" target="_blank">The Creative Independent</a>.)

        <br><br>
        One thing I've learnt about maintaining my emotional health is that you have to view your problems from the right perspective. When you view things from the inside, you can see what the problem is hence able to solve it, but when you are on the outside, things don't appear as straight forward as they may be.

        <span class="italic">Is Collingwood Getting Safer?</span> Is a short video representing my proposition for the use of a disused space in 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/45+Keele+St,+Collingwood+VIC+3066/@-37.7970574,144.9865306,3a,75y,188.48h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sI_v9Wrg3r-zz8D6F-esO3A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ad6431ed373851b:0x9269efe1d57b1c48!8m2!3d-37.7972678!4d144.9864909" target="_blank">Collingwood @45 Keele St. </a> (was a disused studio space).

        <br><br>
        Through exploration and research of Collingwood and interviewing its people— residents, people who work there, students, etc. There seems to be debates on whether Collingwood is actually getting better or worse drawing attention to safety concerns.

        <br><br>
        As a response to this issue, I propose to use the studio space as an installation of CCTV— turning the studio into a virtual alternate of an outdoor space in Collingwood, where people in the studio and people on the street can see each other through live footage on the TVs. As a result, people in the studio unconsciously familiarise themselves with the space on the street (through cctv), and people on the street can feel a sense of security seeing people in the studio are watching out for them. The aim is so that people can feel safer being and living in Collingwood.

        <br><br>
        <span class="italic">Is Collingwood Getting Safer?</span> depicts the reflection of CCTV camera watching the place. The mirror indicates it is the same place at the same time.
