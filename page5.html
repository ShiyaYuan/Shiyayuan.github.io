        motivational speaker <br><br>

        well, today we had an assembly. days before, i heard that we were having this thing. i heard there was going to be a speaker there. big wool!@ i wasn’t happy happy joy joy or anything. but i was getting out of class and going with the a.m assembly schedule. anyhow!@ this speaker looked like danny devito. and he even mentioned his own self looking like him. he was funny as hell and motivated you, by telling true to life stories. he cared about teenagers and doesn’t want the ‘generation x’ going down the drain. he says it only takes one person to make our generation different. that is true. but who will that person be. could it be you, your friend, my friend, or even me. maybe, maybe so.

        but something has to be done. that is one reason i try to take serious side to this text zine, even though i know many people wont even read this text that i type on my computer. i express my feelings and thoughts and release them in this e-zine and hope that someone will read them and understand and change there life somehow. i guess you could compare me with this motivational speaker that came to my school today.

        i’m funny (sure whatever big hurt!@), I’m attractive (snap out if it, yer dreaming!@), and i try to get my points across, i try to tell true to life stories, things that matter, things that come to mind. but the person that will make the difference to our generation, ‘generation x’, is someone that is kind, cares for everyone, believes people can do things, a good speaker, is motivate and can motivate others, a dreamer, and someone that knows what needs to be done and takes charge a situation.

        we’ve seen this person comet of other generations. jackie robinson, martin luther king, john f kennedy, ronald reagan, and many others. and i believe that person will come along and i believe that person can be you, if you apply yourself to your dreams and goals and focus on the steps that will bring your closer to that big dream in the end.
