        parental control <br><br>

        okay, seeing that i just have been relived of a week long period of being grounded i felt i had a good background in this area. What area you ask? well todays issue is parental control and the effects it has on a young “adult”. Laugh at me you may but this is rather a serious issue that all teens face at one point in their life. After sitting through a rather, how should i say it, <span class="highlight hover-3">a extremely degrading conversation with my father where he repeatedly said i was a stupid and had no idea of what my responsibilities are,</span> i sat there and tried to figure out where this anger was coming from. Dis my father just like to yell at me and he found it quite amusing? Well that is very much true and i believe in this wholeheartedly. However i sat there and realised that… hold on.. Yes indeed.. gasp my parents did care about me. Shunned beyond belief, it took me several minutes to actually catch my breath. This is supposed to be a period of my life where the child is supposed to rebel against his parents, disregard all that they spoke. What was wrong with me? I actually was listening to what my father was trying to get across to me. No not the part about me being an idiot (my grades can prove that one), but that i had not held my responsibilities through. i put my parents through over an hour of grief as i came home almost an  hour and a half past my curfew. The whole time i never once thought my parents would care. After realising where they were coming from (quite surprised i must admit), i’ve decided to, yes, actually listen to them and obey the guidelines that they set for me. After all, I turn 18 in two more years and I can move out of the house and live on my own, so i might as well give my parents sometime where they can actually feel like they control me. so the moral of the  story is.. “Whenever a monkey sticks his cock in a guys beer, its funny as hell and its okay to laugh.” — THE END.
