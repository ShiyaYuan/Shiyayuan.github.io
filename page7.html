        today <br><br>

        Well i was going through a fuck issue. trying to find something to read and came upon this. i find th information in this very true and maybe you should just read it and find out about todays society.

        As each day passes, the future grows dimmer. <span class="highlight hover-71">If you catch the news, hear radio talk shows, read the paper, you will always hear about a multitude of bad events that plagued the day.</span> Almost everytime you hear of some tragic event, <span class="highlight hover-72">you hear of some new legislation or some new science that will make events like that less frequent, or more bearable, or something positive.</span> Who are we kidding though? Two years ago the violence was thought to be intolerable. <span class="highlight hover-73">more and more murders were being committed, more prisons were overcrowding, more violent crimes were happening</span>, and overall, people were saying how it would get better because of tougher laws, better living conditions. Look around today. Same thing just a different date. More murders, more gun wielding kids, more overcrowding, more poverty, <span class="highlight hover-74">and like usual, more positive notions of things to come.</span>

        Today I belong to generation x. What is GX? That means I am imbetween the ages of 18 nd 29. I am the generation after the Baby Boomers, and the generation before the named generation running our streets right now. I am considered to be a member of the highest educated generation in America. Like many other members of GX, I blame the Baby Boomers for the hellish world I am forced to survive in. If I get a PHD, or a Master’s, I face the potential of entering the job market ‘Over Qualified’. If I blame the generation before me I must hear something to the effect of “It was tough for us to survive and make a living, no reason it shouldn’t be for you too. ” Throughout my education I have been taught not to be prejudiced, not to be biased, and not to stereotype. Yet I belong to Generation X.

        Today, I must worry about everyone near me, no matter what they look like, or who they are. <span class="highlight hover-75">I know that at any time, my best friends, or a customer in the store I work at could pull a gun, and kill me.</span> Urban violence no longer plagues the poor communities. Two days ago a man pulled a gun from his jacket enough to show the salesman and cashier that he was carrying, then proceeded to tell them “I am walking out of her with this notebook”. Indeed her did, he now owns a top of the line notebook computer. When I drive home, I must be careful not to make eye contact with anyone else around me. If I do, it might be interpreted as ‘staring’. and I must be punished. I can not yell at anyone for driving poorly near me. If I honk or give someone the finger, <span class="highlight hover-76">I am liable to win up dead, just another statistic for the newspapers that will tell me things are getting better.</span>

        Today, maybe that newspaper is right. I am no longer here on this planet.
