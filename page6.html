        an theory on evolution in progress <br><br>

        it seems that everywhere i look that people are getting it. yeah, thats right. sex is everywhere. sex, sex, sex. i can remember just a few decades ago when sex wasn’t even discussed. so it is natural to ask why. 

        why?

        while it is true that mass media in the form of tv, radio, telephones and others came together in the past few years, i don’t think that the messages these forms convey are enough to put America and the rest of the world over the edge.

        it has to be something inside.

        remember back to the fifties. remember the nick-at-nightesque shows which aired. these were some of the best looking people of their time. go and open up that treasured family picture album of the family back in Europe. Notice that they don’t look that great. Auntie Ruth had an interesting face structure, to day the least, eh?

        Now remember back to today at school. some great looking people indeed. remember that one girl? you know, the petite blue-eyed blonde who makes you think of things that shouldn’t exactly be discussed at the dinner table. my school has about a billion of these “beautiful girls,”. Now i don’t know what the thought process is for women, but my guess is it is the same in the sense that they know who looks better than someone else.

        refer back to auntie ruth’s picture. blah! not exactly the cheerleader in homeroom.

        now i believe in evolution, and “survival of the fittest,” but not in the same huge scale that it is on. I don’t believe it took us 900 million years to lose some hair and get that drink out of our back.

        i mean, come one. doesn’t it look as if people got better looking as of late? did you want to do Auntie Ruth instead of that half the girls last hour?

        if a species doesn’t breed, they die out. pretty simple to me. so if we do it more, isn’t it likely that we have more kids? so, isn’t it natural for people to breed to look better? why not? to silly? i doubt it. Some animals evolve extra appendages to help feeding. or webbed feet to help swimming. And this on an animal which resides in the air. (a duck, stupid!)

        everywhere you look, beautiful people. left, right. maybe even cross. hmm, didn’t always seem like this.

        if this isn’t darwinian theory, then what is happening to us? i personally think we look great. at least as a whole. i also think that we didn’t always look this good. bust out that history book you haven’t looked at all year. check out the renaissance, the enlightenment, the revolution. this is when paintings finally become accurate. i personally don’t think that catherine the great was that great at all. how about Marie Antoinette? i would have to say about a 4.

        refer back to Auntie Ruth’s mug. well, better than Joan of Arc.

        I think it has been centuries of evolution, but it has been up until the past few decades when mother nature took a good look at itself and decided it would trace the face before painting it on.

        Radical evolution in the past few years, I’m telling you.

        so, savour this time of our own greatness, and make sure to roll around in ti, that is what it is meant for.
