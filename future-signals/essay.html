        <h1>As facial recognition use grows, so do privacy fears</h1>

         The unique features of your face can allow you to unlock your new iPhone, access your bank account or even "smile to pay" for some goods and services.

        <p>
          The same technology, using algorithms generated by a facial scan, can allow law enforcement to find a wanted person in a crowd or match the image of someone in police custody to a database of known offenders. Facial recognition is playing an increasing role in law enforcement, border security and other purposes in the US and around the world.

        <p>
          While most observers acknowledge the merits of some uses of this biometric identification, the technology evokes fears of a "Big Brother" surveillance state. Heightening those concerns are studies showing facial recognition may not always be accurate, especially for people of color. A 2016 Georgetown University study found that one in two American adults, or 117 million people, are in facial recognition databases with few rules on how these systems may be accessed. A growing fear for civil liberties activists is that law enforcement will deploy facial recognition in "real time" through drones, body cameras and dash cams.

        <p>
          "The real concern is police on patrol identifying law-abiding Americans at will with body cameras," said Matthew Feeney, specialist in emerging technologies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. 
        </p>

        <p>
          "This technology is of course improving but it's not as accurate as science fiction films would make you think."
        </p>

        <p>
          China is at the forefront of facial recognition, using the technology to fine traffic violators and "shame" jaywalkers, with at least one arrest of a criminal suspect.
        </p>

        <p>
         Clare Garvie, lead author of the 2016 Georgetown study, said that in the past two years, "facial recognition has been deployed in a more widespread and aggressive manner" in the US, including for border security and at least one international airport.
        </p>

        <p>
         "Facial recognition-powered government surveillance is an extraordinary invasion of the privacy of all citizensâ€”and a slippery slope to losing control of our identities altogether."
