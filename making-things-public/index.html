        Public spaces are an important part of our cities as they provide opportunities for people to gather and engage with the community. However, things are a bit different in the Australian context. Throughout history, under the influence of European colonisation, the Melbourne city was never designed to encourage sociality in public space as such could promote rebellion. As a result, people claiming spaces in alleyways, corners and carparks as their social public space, has become a “normal” part of our urban social life.

        As a response to this issue, Make It a Party Wherever You Go aims to increase people’s awareness of their physical surroundings and hopes to encourage and promote interaction with the urban public space.
