        sometimes life sucks <br><br>

        remember how today was suppose to be my birthday. big whoopee, right? wrong. first off my dad didn’t get me anything, so we went out for lunch and went shopping. i got nirvana itv unplugged and baseball batting gloves. like i really get to bat and all i do is pitch anyhow.

        then my mom wants to go shopping. i just don’t get it. i don’t care what i get and want the little enjoyment of opening a present. which haven’t been able to since i was like 11 years old.

        she wants to take me shopping, so i told her no i don’t want anything at all. 

        she wants to go before it gets too late.

        she is putting stress on me when she actually thinks it will make me feel better. she also got me a cake when i didn’t want one. all i want is a bass guitar which both of my parents could have pitched in for under 70 dollars if they got their heads out of their asses and woke up. but not, they make me feel like shit on my birthday, which is suppose to be a big happy day for you since it is your day and not anyone else day. just yours and they kinda ruined it for me.
